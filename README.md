# TSP
### v 1.0.0
This program contains a function that solves any travelling salesman problem using a greedy algorithm and heap queue to maximize efficiency.

The function accepts a 2-D list representing an adjacency matrix such as the following:
```
[
    [0, 2, 3, 0, 1],
    [2, 0, 15, 2, 20],
    [3, 15, 0, 20, 13],
    [0, 2, 20, 0, 0],
    [1, 20, 13, 0, 0],
]
```

To clone and use this function, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer.
